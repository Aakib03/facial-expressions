# facial-expressions
I have used this fer library which describes facial expressions using pretrained  HDF5 model which inturn is based on cnn. The FER contains the Keras model built with convolutional neural networks and weights saved in HDF5 model. Alternatively, there’s Peltarion API which could be used in the backend in place of Keras model. MTCNN stands for multi cascade convolutional network. It is an advanced technique for detecting faces. If mtcnn=False then by default OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier is used. Lastly, the detect_emotions() function is called to classify the emotion into ‘happy’, ’sad’, ‘disgust’, ‘anger’, ‘fear’, ‘neutral’ with values for each.
